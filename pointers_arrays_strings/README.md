## Description
This project focuses on the use of pointers, arrays, and strings in C programming. It includes various scripts to practice these concepts.

## Requirements
- GCC compiler
- A text editor or IDE (e.g., Visual Studio Code, CLion)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/JaysonPasquier/holbertonschool-low_level_programming.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd holbertonschool-low_level_programming/pointers_arrays_strings
    ```

## Usage
To compile any of the files, use the following command:
```sh
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic <filename.c> -o <output_name>
```
To run the compiled program:
```sh
./<output_name>
```

## Files
- `0-reset_to_98.c`: Function that takes a pointer to an int as parameter and updates the value it points to to 98.
- `1-swap.c`: Function that swaps the values of two integers.
- `2-strlen.c`: Function that returns the length of a string.
- `3-puts.c`: Function that prints a string, followed by a new line.
- `4-print_rev.c`: Function that prints a string in reverse.
