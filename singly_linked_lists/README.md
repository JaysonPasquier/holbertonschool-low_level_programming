## Description
This project focuses on the use of singly linked lists in C programming. It includes various scripts to practice these concepts.

## Requirements
- GCC compiler
- A text editor or IDE (e.g., Visual Studio Code, CLion)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/JaysonPasquier/holbertonschool-low_level_programming.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd holbertonschool-low_level_programming/singly_linked_lists
    ```

## Usage
To compile any of the files, use the following command:
```sh
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic <filename.c> -o <output_name>
```
To run the compiled program:
```sh
./<output_name>
```

## Files
- `0-print_list.c`: Function that prints all the elements of a `list_t` list.
- `1-list_len.c`: Function that returns the number of elements in a linked `list_t` list.
- `2-add_node.c`: Function that adds a new node at the beginning of a `list_t` list.
- `3-add_node_end.c`: Function that adds a new node at the end of a `list_t` list.
- `4-free_list.c`: Function that frees a `list_t` list.
