## Description
This project focuses on the use of variables, conditional statements, and loops in C programming. It includes various scripts to practice these concepts.

## Requirements
- GCC compiler
- A text editor or IDE (e.g., Visual Studio Code, CLion)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/JaysonPasquier/holbertonschool-low_level_programming.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd holbertonschool-low_level_programming/variables_if_else_while
    ```

## Usage
To compile any of the files, use the following command:
```sh
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic <filename.c> -o <output_name>
```
To run the compiled program:
```sh
./<output_name>
```

## Files
- `0-positive_or_negative.c`: Program that determines if a number is positive, negative, or zero.
- `1-last_digit.c`: Program that prints the last digit of a randomly generated number.
- `2-print_alphabet.c`: Program that prints the alphabet in lowercase.
- `3-print_alphabets.c`: Program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase.
- `4-print_alphabt.c`: Program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, except for 'q' and 'e'.
