## Description
This project focuses on the use of recursion in C programming. It includes various scripts to practice these concepts.

## Requirements
- GCC compiler
- A text editor or IDE (e.g., Visual Studio Code, CLion)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/JaysonPasquier/holbertonschool-low_level_programming.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd holbertonschool-low_level_programming/recursion
    ```

## Usage
To compile any of the files, use the following command:
```sh
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic <filename.c> -o <output_name>
```
To run the compiled program:
```sh
./<output_name>
```

## Files
- `0-puts_recursion.c`: Function that prints a string, followed by a new line.
- `1-print_rev_recursion.c`: Function that prints a string in reverse.
- `2-strlen_recursion.c`: Function that returns the length of a string.
- `3-factorial.c`: Function that returns the factorial of a given number.
- `4-pow_recursion.c`: Function that returns the value of `x` raised to the power of `y`.
