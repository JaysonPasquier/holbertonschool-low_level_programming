## Description
This project focuses on the use of structures and typedef in C programming. It includes various scripts to practice these concepts.

## Requirements
- GCC compiler
- A text editor or IDE (e.g., Visual Studio Code, CLion)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/JaysonPasquier/holbertonschool-low_level_programming.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd holbertonschool-low_level_programming/structures_typedef
    ```

## Usage
To compile any of the files, use the following command:
```sh
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic <filename.c> -o <output_name>
```
To run the compiled program:
```sh
./<output_name>
```

## Files
- `dog.h`: Header file that defines a new type `struct dog`.
- `1-init_dog.c`: Function that initializes a variable of type `struct dog`.
- `2-print_dog.c`: Function that prints a `struct dog`.
- `4-new_dog.c`: Function that creates a new dog.
