# More Functions and Nested Loops

This directory contains projects and exercises related to more functions and nested loops in C programming.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand how to use functions and nested loops.
- Learn how to create and use more complex functions.
- Implement functions that use nested loops.

## Files

- `0-isupper.c`: Function that checks for uppercase character.
- `1-isdigit.c`: Function that checks for a digit (0 through 9).
- `2-mul.c`: Function that multiplies two integers.
- `3-print_numbers.c`: Function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9.
- `4-print_most_numbers.c`: Function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, except 2 and 4.

## Usage

To compile any of the files, use the following command:
```sh
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic <filename.c> -o <output_name>
```

To run the compiled program:
