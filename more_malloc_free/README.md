## Description
This project focuses on the use of `malloc` and `free` for dynamic memory allocation in C programming. It includes various scripts to practice these concepts.

## Requirements
- GCC compiler
- A text editor or IDE (e.g., Visual Studio Code, CLion)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/JaysonPasquier/holbertonschool-low_level_programming.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd holbertonschool-low_level_programming/more_malloc_free
    ```

## Usage
To compile any of the files, use the following command:
```sh
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic <filename.c> -o <output_name>
```
To run the compiled program:
```sh
./<output_name>
```

## Files
- `0-malloc_checked.c`: Function that allocates memory using `malloc`.
- `1-string_nconcat.c`: Function that concatenates two strings.
- `2-calloc.c`: Function that allocates memory for an array, using `malloc`.
- `3-array_range.c`: Function that creates an array of integers.
